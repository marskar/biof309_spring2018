There are many other great software tools that we do not have time to discuss this semester.
This folder contains configuration files for a few such tools, just in case anyone is curious.

This semester we will focus on the Anaconda Python 3.6 distribution and the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). 
These are required course materials and I will not troubleshoot the installation and use of any other tools, IDEs, and distributions. 

The only exception to the above is [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), which we will use later in the semester.
Currently, JupyterLab is in [early beta stage](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestones) and I want to give the project more time to develop before we implement it in our class.

If you are curious about the following tools:
- atom text editor
- conda package and environment manager
- classic jupyter notebooks
please look at the [config folder in the GitHub repo from last semester](https://github.com/marskar/BIOF309_Fall2017/tree/master/config).

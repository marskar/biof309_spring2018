For example, if you're writing a conditional if-else structure, you might start by putting a print statement for the else code block, allowing you to get on with writing and testing the if code block.\n",

However, it would not be much use in a real ATM, as for this purpose, the function would need to return information to the ATM system that called it, so that the ATM would know how to proceed. For example, if the user requested a withdrawal, the ATM would need to know how much money to issue before returning the user's card. If the PIN was entered incorrectly, then the ATM should know to give back (or perhaps withhold) the user's card, etc.\n",

For example, the following function tests if a number is positive (greater than or equal to 0), and returns (or gives back) the value *True* if it is, or otherwise gives back the value *False*."

The code you have written so far is hopefully fairly readable, but if the functionality is extended much further, it could easily become long-winded and hard to read. For example, a real ATM might allow three attempts at entering the PIN before refusing to continue. It might allow you to conduct several transactions in one visit to the ATM. The amount you are allowed to withdraw is typically restricted, based on various factors (e.g. your current balance, and a maximum daily withdrawal amount).
